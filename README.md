## Game Instructions

Classic Arcade Game Clone includes following two characters:

-   A player (who need to cross the rocks area without colliding
    with enemies to finish the game).
-   Enemies (who will be moving across the rock area to obstruct the path of the player).

To start playing the game, you need to remember following basic keyboard controls:

-   Press Up arrow key: to move one block ahead.
-   Press Down arrow key: to move one block back.
-   Press Left arrow key: to move one block left.
-   Press Right arrow key: to move one block right.

As soon the game loads, you just need to follow following guidelines to complete the game:

-   Just try to cross the rock area without colliding with the enemies.
-   Navigate across the game board(using the arrow keys) to save your player's life from the Enemies.

Once you finishes the game,

-   There would be a winning modal (which stops for a while).
-   And it also a provide button for restarting the game.
